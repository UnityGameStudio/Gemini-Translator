# Installation

To use the **Gemini Unity Translator**, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before importing the Gemini Unity Translator package, you'll need to download and install the following dependencies:

1. **Unity Text-to-Speech using Google Cloud**  
   - This package provides necessary functions for **Text to Speech**.  
   - [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/anomalisfree/Unity-Text-to-Speech-using-Google-Cloud)


### Step 2: Import Gemini-Translator Package

Once the dependencies are set up, **open** the example scene inside the package. The scene provides a User Interface with some languages to translate.   

You activate the function by pressing the space bar and releasing it. Then, Unity processes the audio through Speech-To-Text. Later, Gemini translates the sentences to the desired language. And finally, Unity process the audio through a Text-To-Speech. Both services of audio processing are done through Google Cloud Services. Therefore, you will need certain API keys from [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/).

You also need an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
